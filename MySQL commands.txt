* A table is a database object that is composed of rows and columns and contains related data.
* A table is created in SQL using the "CREATE TABLE" command.

* A field is a column in a table that is supposed to provide specific information about all records in the table.

* A record is a row in a table. It is also known as "horizontal entity of a table".

* A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains information associated with a specific field.

* Null Value is NO VALUE. It is a space or zero, it is NOTHING!
* While inserting data in a table, if you do not provide value for a cell, the cell is said to contain Null Value.

DROP DATABASE databasename; : drop,delete the databasename from the system

* A data type is a property that specifies the type of data you can put in your table.
* Each field has a data-type and all values for a field that have the same data-type.

* Numeric Fields : a)Bigint (really big values!), b)Int (big values), c)Smallint (-32,768 to 32,767), d)Tinyint(0 to 255) 

* Datetime(YYYY-MM HH:MM:SS)
* Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
* Time (HH:MM:SS)
* Year (YYYY)

* BLOB (Binary Large Object) : to store images

* If you want to make sure that a field gets some value for every row in the table, apply the not null constraint to it.

* If while populating a table, you miss giving a column some value, the default value will be used.

* Unique Constraint makes sure that all values entered for the field on which the constraint is applied are different.

DESC tablename; : display, describe the tablename contents

DROP TABLE tablename; : drop, remove the tablename from the database

SHOW TABLES; : show all the tables in the database

TRUNCATE TABLE tablename; : truncate, delete all the data in tablename

* MySQL operator symbols : +, -, *, /, <. >, =
* MySQL operators generally used with the WHERE clause, it is used to limit the number of rows obtained in the output.
* MySQL types of operators: a) arithmetic, b) comparison, c) logical, d) reverse
* MySQL arithmetic operators : a)Addition(+), b)Subtraction(-), c)Multiplication(*), d)Division(/), e)Modular Division(%)

SELECT number + number; : do addition operation
SELECT number - number; : do subraction operation
SELECT number * number; : do multiplication operation
SELECT number / number; : do division operation
SELECT number % number; : do modulus operation

* MySQL comparison operators used to compare data present in columns to data specified in conditions.

* MySQL operators : 1)Equal To (=), 2)Not Equal To (<>), 3)Greater Than (>), 4)Less Than (<), 5)Greater Than or Equal To (>=), 6)Less Than or Equal To (<=)

SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary<15000; : display all the information from employee database where salary is below 15000

SELECT salary FROM employee HERE nam='John'; : display salary of John from the employee database

* MySQL logical operators are to create complex query conditions
* MySQL logical operator types : a)ALL, b)AND, c)BETWEEN, d)IN, e)IN, f)LIKE, g)IS NULL

SELECT * 
FROM employee
WHERE age<=30 AND salary<=25000; : display all the rows data of employee table that contain age above and equals to 30 and salary below and equal to 25000 from the employee table

SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE salary IS NULL; : display all employee table data where salary got null value or no value at all

SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE name LIKE 'p%'; : display all the employee rows data where name start with p character

SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE age IN (28,30,36); : display all the employee records where the age is 28,30,36

SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE age BETWEEN 28 AND 36; : display all the employee records where the age is between 28 and 36

SELECT * 
FROM employee
WHERE age < ALL (SELECT age FROM employee WHERE salary>20000); : display all employee table data where age is below all the age in employee table data where their salary is above 20000

* WHERE clause is used to include a condition while fetching data from tables. It is also used to join multiple tables.

SELECT column_list
FROM table_name
[WHERE condition]; : display all the data from table_name where column_list meet the condition

SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE name = 'Kurt'; : display from employee data table where column has name equal to Kurt

* AND or OR operators are used to combine multiple conditions specified with the WHERE clause.
* AND makes it necessary for all conditions to be true.
* OR works even if any one is true

SELECT * 
FROM employee
WHERE salary > 15000 OR age < 30; : display all the records of employee data table where their salary is above 15000 or their age is below 30

* UPDATE query is used to update rows in a table
* UPDATE query generally used with the WHERE clause

UPDATE employee
SET age=26
WHERE id=19000; : update the employee data table by setting the age to 26 where id is 19000

* The DELETE query is used to delete records from a table
* DELETE query mostly used with the WHERE clause

DELETE FROM table_name
[WHERE condition]; : delete from table_name where it meets the stated condition

* LIKE operator is used to compare a value to similar values in a table of the database.
* LIKE operator is used with Wildcard characters.

* Wildcard Characters : 1)% (percentage symbol : substitution for zero, one or many characters), 2)_ (underscore character : stands for one character or number)

SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE email LIKE '%hotmail%'; : display from employee data table where their email got hotmail extension in it

SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE age LIKE '2_'; : display from employee data table where their age start with 2 in 2 digit format

FROM employee
LIMIT 5; : display top 5 columns from employee table data

* MySQL ORDER BY clause is to sort data fetched from a table.

SELECT *
FROM employee
ORDER BY name; : sort the employee data table, order by their name

SELECT *
FROM employee
ORDER BY age; : display employee data table sort by their youngest age

SELECT *
FROM employee
ORDER BY age DESC; : display employee data table sort by their oldest age

SELECT *
FROM employee
ORDER BY salary DESC; : display employee data table sort by their highest salary

* GROUP BY clause is used to array indentical data in groups
* GROUP BY clause is used with the SELECT query
* GROUP BY must always follow the WHERE clause and must precede the ORDER BY clause
