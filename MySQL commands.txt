* A table is a database object that is composed of rows and columns and contains related data.
* A table is created in SQL using the "CREATE TABLE" command.

* A field is a column in a table that is supposed to provide specific information about all records in the table.

* A record is a row in a table. It is also known as "horizontal entity of a table".

* A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains information associated with a specific field.

* Null Value is NO VALUE. It is a space or zero, it is NOTHING!
* While inserting data in a table, if you do not provide value for a cell, the cell is said to contain Null Value.

DROP DATABASE databasename; : drop,delete the databasename from the system

* A data type is a property that specifies the type of data you can put in your table.
* Each field has a data-type and all values for a field that have the same data-type.

* Numeric Fields : a)Bigint (really big values!), b)Int (big values), c)Smallint (-32,768 to 32,767), d)Tinyint(0 to 255) 

* Datetime(YYYY-MM HH:MM:SS)
* Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
* Time (HH:MM:SS)
* Year (YYYY)

* BLOB (Binary Large Object) : to store images

* If you want to make sure that a field gets some value for every row in the table, apply the not null constraint to it.

* If while populating a table, you miss giving a column some value, the default value will be used.

* Unique Constraint makes sure that all values entered for the field on which the constraint is applied are different.
